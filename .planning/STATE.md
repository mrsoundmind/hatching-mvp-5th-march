# State: Hatchin MVP

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** No one should ever feel alone with their idea, have to start from scratch, or need to know how to prompt AI — just have a conversation and your team takes it from there.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 complete — ready for Phase 4

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — Hatch Presence and Avatar System — complete
Plan: 01 complete (1 of 1 plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Product Vision (critical — inform all decisions)
- Hatchin solves the **prompting barrier** — users talk naturally, Hatches handle the AI complexity underneath
- Target user: anyone with an idea, regardless of technical background
- The bridge: dream → team → execution
- Use cases span all domains: designer gets better at design, founder gets product built, developer thinks through architecture
- "Never alone, never from scratch, never have to prompt" — these three are the north star
- **Current phase focus: text/conversation perfection. No new modalities yet.**
- Future roadmap (not now): image generation, Claude coding integration, voice input

### What's been built (this session)
- 26 SVG avatars redesigned with Hatchin design system (radial gradients, 3-layer eyes, indigo ring)
- Per-character unique idle micro-animations (brow/mouth per personality)
- Thinking bubble added to AvatarWrapper (replaces head tilt)
- `agentRole` added to message metadata in `routes.ts`
- AgentAvatar wired into MessageBubble, ProjectTree, RightSidebar, CenterPanel
- Character names (Alex, Dev, Cleo, etc.) shown instead of role names
- Phase 2: LandingPage wired to router for logged-out users (02-01)
- Phase 2: Typing indicator cleared when AI streaming starts (02-02)
- Phase 2: agentRole backfill in GET messages read path — old messages enriched at read time (02-03)
- Phase 3 (03-01): adaptedTraits + adaptationMeta persisted to agents.personality JSONB after every thumbs reaction and explicit feedback submission (PRES-05)

### Phase 2 gap items status
- UX-01/UX-02: Project creation — addressed in plan 02-05
- UX-05: Team accordion animation glitch — addressed in plan 02-07
- UX-07: RESOLVED in 02-06 — streaming placeholder now includes agentRole from activeProjectAgents at creation time
- UX-08: RESOLVED in 02-06 — typing indicators mutually exclusive; typingColleagues cleared on send
- DATA-04: RESOLVED in 02-06 — agentRole backfill useEffect guarded against empty activeProjectAgents list

### What's been built (02-06)
- CenterPanel.tsx: streaming_started handler injects agentRole from activeProjectAgents into placeholder message metadata
- CenterPanel.tsx: apiMessages transform useEffect guards with `if (activeProjectAgents.length === 0) return`
- CenterPanel.tsx: in-message-list typing bubble gated on `typingColleagues.length === 0`
- CenterPanel.tsx: both submit handlers call `setTypingColleagues([])` alongside `setIsThinking(true)`
