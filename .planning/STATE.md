# State: Hatchin

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** No one should ever feel alone with their idea, have to start from scratch, or need to know how to prompt AI — just have a conversation and your team takes it from there.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — Background Execution Foundation (ready to plan)

Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-19 — Completed 06-03 (TaskExecutionPipeline + pg-boss worker + cost cap)

Progress: [███████░░░] 75% (v1.1 milestone)

## Decisions

| Date | Phase | Decision |
|------|-------|----------|
| 2026-03-19 | Roadmap | pg-boss for durable job queue over existing Neon PostgreSQL — no Redis |
| 2026-03-19 | Roadmap | Autonomous artifacts go to autonomy_events only; one Maya summary message in chat on return |
| 2026-03-19 | Roadmap | Safety threshold stricter in autonomous mode (0.60 vs 0.80) — no user message present |
| 2026-03-19 | Roadmap | Inactivity trigger gated behind INACTIVITY_AUTONOMY_ENABLED flag — Phase 9 only |
| 2026-03-19 | Roadmap | Do NOT call runTurn from background execution — call generateText directly |

---
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: resolveAutonomyTrigger is a pure function with no I/O — testable without mocking, reusable across chat and inactivity triggers
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: pg-boss uses its own pg driver against DATABASE_URL while Drizzle keeps @neondatabase/serverless — two separate connection paths intentional
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: backgroundExecution feature flag defaults to false — autonomous execution is opt-in via BACKGROUND_AUTONOMY_ENABLED=true
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: AUTONOMOUS_SAFETY_THRESHOLDS exported separately from SAFETY_THRESHOLDS — autonomous pipeline uses it directly, needsClarification remains chat-only
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: generateText injected as dependency into executeTask — never imports runTurn or graph.invoke (plan invariant enforced by Test 3)
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: handleTaskJob checks cost cap FIRST before resolving task/agent/project — minimizes DB queries on cap-reached path
- [Phase 06-background-execution-foundation]: startTaskWorker returns no-op when getJobQueue() returns null (BACKGROUND_AUTONOMY_ENABLED=false) — feature is cleanly opt-in

## Blockers / Concerns

- ~~Phase 6 planning: verify pg-boss compatibility with @neondatabase/serverless driver~~ RESOLVED — pg-boss uses its own standard pg driver; no conflict with Neon serverless driver
- Phase 7 planning: verify conductor evaluateConductorDecision produces stable routing when called with synthetic task description as userMessage
