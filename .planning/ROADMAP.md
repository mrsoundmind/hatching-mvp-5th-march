### 🚧 v1.1 Autonomous Execution Loop (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Hatches don't just talk — they execute. Users trigger work, Hatches hand off tasks between each other, self-review quality, and present real results. The user comes back to completed work and a chat summary of what happened.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 6: Background Execution Foundation** — Safe single-agent execution pipeline with cost guardrails and explicit trigger
- [ ] **Phase 7: Agent Handoffs and Approval UI** — Full multi-agent handoff chain with interactive approval cards and pause/cancel controls
- [ ] **Phase 8: Chat Summary and Tab Notifications** — Maya briefing on user return and browser tab badge when work completes offline
- [ ] **Phase 9: Progressive Trust and Inactivity Trigger** — Trust score accumulation and inactivity-based auto-trigger gated by feature flag

## Phase Details

### Phase 6: Background Execution Foundation
**Goal**: Users can trigger autonomous execution and watch their Hatches produce real output safely
**Depends on**: v1.0 platform (LangGraph, safety gates, task graph — all existing)
**Requirements**: EXEC-01, EXEC-02, EXEC-03, SAFE-01, SAFE-02, SAFE-03, UX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can tell a Hatch to "go ahead and work on this" and the system acknowledges and begins execution
  2. A "Team is working..." indicator appears in chat and remains visible while background execution runs
  3. Low-risk tasks complete automatically and their output (plans, breakdowns, research) appears as Hatch messages
  4. High-risk tasks surface an approval request in chat rather than executing silently
  5. No single project exceeds its daily LLM spend cap regardless of how many tasks are queued
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01-PLAN.md — AutonomyTriggerResolver, policies.ts cost cap, pg-boss job queue setup
- [ ] 06-02-PLAN.md — safety.ts autonomous execution context extension
- [ ] 06-03-PLAN.md — TaskExecutionPipeline with peer review gate and output storage
- [ ] 06-04-PLAN.md — backgroundRunner cron, chat.ts trigger hook, CenterPanel working indicator

### Phase 7: Agent Handoffs and Approval UI
**Goal**: Hatches pass work to each other in character and users approve or reject high-risk actions with one click
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: HAND-01, HAND-02, HAND-03, HAND-04, UX-01, UX-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After a Hatch completes a task, the next appropriate specialist Hatch automatically picks up the relevant follow-on task
  2. The receiving Hatch announces the handoff in chat in its own voice ("Got it, picking this up from PM")
  3. The handoff chain cannot loop — if a cycle is detected, execution stops and the user is notified
  4. Each Hatch in the chain has access to the previous Hatch's output when composing its response
  5. User can approve or reject a high-risk action proposal with a single button click, no typing required
  6. User can pause or cancel all ongoing autonomous execution at any point
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: HandoffOrchestrator with cycle detection (visitedAgentIds + maxHops)
- [ ] 07-02: In-character handoff messages via proactiveOutreach pipeline
- [ ] 07-03: Approval endpoints (POST /api/tasks/:id/approve and /reject) and approval card frontend component
- [ ] 07-04: Pause/cancel controls (POST /api/projects/:id/autonomy/pause) and frontend integration

### Phase 8: Chat Summary and Tab Notifications
**Goal**: Users return to a conversational briefing from Maya and never miss completed work due to an inactive tab
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: UX-03, UX-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a user returns after autonomous work completed, Maya delivers exactly one briefing message leading with outcomes ("Authentication module scoped — two items need your review"), not process details
  2. The briefing does not repeat if the user sends another message shortly after; it appears once per absence session
  3. The browser tab title shows a badge or flashing indicator when autonomous work completes while the tab is in the background
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: SummaryBriefingBuilder with idempotency guard and join_conversation trigger hook
- [ ] 08-02: Browser tab notification (document.title badge + Page Visibility API detection)

### Phase 9: Progressive Trust and Inactivity Trigger
**Goal**: Agents earn higher autonomy through track record and the system can start working when users go idle
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: EXEC-04, SAFE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An agent that has completed tasks successfully is offered higher-risk work without manual approval over time
  2. After 4+ hours of user inactivity, queued autonomous work begins automatically (when feature flag enabled)
  3. The inactivity trigger can be disabled per-project without affecting any other autonomy behavior
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: Trust score accumulation on task completion and autonomy threshold adjustment
- [ ] 09-02: Inactivity detection cron job gated by INACTIVITY_AUTONOMY_ENABLED flag
