## 🚧 v3.0 Reliable Autonomy (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Harden the autonomous execution loop so users can trust it. Close the check-then-act budget race via atomic enforcement, then layer scheduled routines ("every Monday 9am, Kai drafts the growth update") on top of a now-correct budget ledger — chat-native creation, never a cron UI.

**Ordering constraint (hard):** Phase 22 (atomic budget) must land before Phase 24 (scheduler). Scheduling multiplies concurrency pressure; a racy budget under a scheduler is the exact runaway-spend scenario this milestone exists to prevent.

### Phases

- [ ] **Phase 22: Atomic Budget Enforcement** — Ledger table + reserve/release + pipeline rewire + daily reconciliation
- [ ] **Phase 23: Budget UX Surfaces** — UsageBar autonomy extension, 80% warn, in-character hard-stop, blocked events in feed, Free-tier upgrade path
- [ ] **Phase 24: Scheduler Foundation** — scheduled_routines table, pg-boss cron wrapper, pipeline hook, auto-pause, REST API, tier gating
- [ ] **Phase 25: Chat-Native Routine Creation** — SCHEDULE_REQUEST intent, NL → cron parser, in-character confirmation card, injection defense
- [ ] **Phase 26: Routines Management Panel** — Sidebar tab, routine cards, pause/resume/run-now/delete, past-run history, return-briefing + tab-badge integration
- [ ] **Phase 27: Polish + Integration Hardening** — Concurrency verify, DST tests, multi-replica single-fire, red-team injection suite

---

## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Sidebar Shell + Activity Feed
**Goal**: Users can see real-time autonomy activity in a tabbed right sidebar — the gating architectural foundation for the entire milestone
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.3 milestone)
**Requirements**: SIDE-01, SIDE-02, SIDE-03, SIDE-04, FEED-01, FEED-02, FEED-03, FEED-04, FEED-05, AGNT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees a right sidebar with three tabs (Activity, Brain & Docs, Approvals) and switching between them works without losing scroll position or draft state
  2. User sees a live activity feed that updates in real time as autonomous work happens, showing agent avatar, event description, and timestamp for each event
  3. User sees a stats card at the top of the Activity tab showing tasks completed, handoffs, and cost spent today
  4. User can filter the feed by event type, agent, or time range using filter chips without a page reload
  5. Agent avatars in the left sidebar and project tree show a pulsing ring when that agent is actively executing a background task
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 11-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: typed event registry, sidebar hooks, backend stats/events endpoints
- [ ] 11-02-PLAN.md — Tab shell: 3-tab RightSidebar restructure with CSS-hide, badges, empty states
- [ ] 11-03-PLAN.md — Activity feed UI: stats card, filter chips, feed items, agent working avatar

### Phase 12: Handoff Visualization
**Goal**: Users can see handoff chains between agents — both in the chat as styled cards and in the sidebar as a timeline
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: HAND-01, HAND-02, HAND-03, HAND-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a handoff occurs, the chat panel shows a styled card with the from-agent avatar, an arrow, the to-agent avatar, and the task being handed off
  2. The Activity tab sidebar shows a vertical handoff chain timeline with animated connectors linking the sequence of agents involved in a multi-agent run
  3. User can initiate a manual handoff by clicking "Hand off to..." in the chat input and selecting a target agent from a dropdown
  4. When multiple agents are coordinating, user sees a collapsible deliberation indicator card in chat that can be expanded to show coordination details
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 12-01-PLAN.md — HandoffCard + DeliberationCard in chat, CenterPanel wiring, handoff event dispatch
- [ ] 12-02-PLAN.md — HandoffChainTimeline in sidebar, manual handoff dropdown in chat input

### Phase 13: Approvals Hub + Task Pipeline
**Goal**: Users have a dedicated approvals surface and can see task progress across pipeline stages without digging through chat
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: APPR-01, APPR-02, APPR-03, APPR-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view all pending approval requests in the Approvals tab and approve or reject any item with a single click without leaving the sidebar
  2. User can see tasks organized by pipeline stage (Queued, Assigned, In Progress, Review, Done) in a view readable at the sidebar's narrow width
  3. When an approval expires, user sees a clear "expired" state on that item instead of a broken approve button or silent failure
  4. When no approvals are pending, the Approvals tab shows an engaging empty state explaining what the tab is for and how approvals are created
**Plans**: 2 plans

### Phase 14: Brain Redesign + Autonomy Settings
**Goal**: Users can build a real knowledge base by uploading documents to the project brain, and can configure how autonomously their Hatches operate
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: BRAIN-01, BRAIN-02, BRAIN-03, BRAIN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can drag-and-drop a PDF, DOCX, TXT, or MD file onto the Brain & Docs tab to upload it (up to 10MB), and the file's content becomes searchable context for Hatches
  2. Uploaded documents appear in a card-based list showing filename, type badge, upload date, and a delete button
  3. User can configure autonomy behavior via a settings panel: toggle autonomous execution on/off, set the inactivity trigger, and choose an autonomy level from a four-position dial (Observe / Propose / Confirm / Autonomous)
  4. User can browse completed work outputs from background agents in an expandable card view without scrolling through full chat history
**Plans**: 2 plans

### Phase 15: Polish
**Goal**: All new sidebar components feel premium and visually consistent with Hatchin's established design system
**Depends on**: Phases 11-14
**Requirements**: PLSH-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All new sidebar tab components use designs generated via Stitch/Magic MCPs and are visually indistinguishable from the quality level of existing Hatchin components
  2. New components are consistent in spacing, color usage, typography, and animation style with the established Tailwind design tokens and Framer Motion patterns across the app
**Plans**: 6 plans

### Phase 16: Database Foundation + Artifact Panel Shell
**Goal**: Users can open a split-panel artifact viewer beside chat that displays deliverables with attribution
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: ARTF-01, ARTF-02, ARTF-03, ARTF-04, COORD-01
**Plans**: Shipped

### Phase 17: Deliverable Generation + Schema Enforcement
**Goal**: Users can request a structured deliverable and watch it stream into the artifact panel
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: DLVR-01, DLVR-02, DLVR-03, DLVR-04, DLVR-05
**Plans**: Shipped

### Phase 18: Cross-Agent Deliverable Chains
**Goal**: Downstream Hatches produce linked documents that reference upstream content substantively
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: CHAIN-01, CHAIN-02, CHAIN-03, CHAIN-04, COORD-02
**Plans**: Shipped

### Phase 19: Organic Detection + Iteration UX
**Goal**: Hatches propose deliverables when conversation has sufficient context; iteration is surgical
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: DTCT-01, DTCT-02
**Plans**: Shipped

### Phase 20: Project Packages + Background Production
**Goal**: Users can trigger a coordinated multi-agent deliverable package and track progress
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: PKG-01, PKG-02, PKG-03
**Plans**: Shipped

### Phase 21: Zero-Friction Onboarding + PDF Export
**Goal**: First deliverable within 3 minutes of signup; any deliverable exportable as branded PDF
**Depends on**: Phases 19, 17
**Requirements**: ONBD-01, ONBD-02, XPRT-01, XPRT-02
**Plans**: Shipped

---

### Phase 22: Atomic Budget Enforcement
**Goal**: Concurrent background tasks can never bypass the per-project daily autonomy budget — the check-then-act race at `taskExecutionPipeline.ts:543-560` is closed by a transactional reserve/release ledger that is the single source of truth
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v3.0; blocks Phase 24)
**Requirements**: BUDG-01, BUDG-02, BUDG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When N concurrent autonomous tasks race for the last budget slot at a limit of K, exactly K succeed and N-K are blocked — verified by a concurrency integration test (e.g. 10 concurrent, K=5 → 5 pass, 5 blocked)
  2. When an autonomous task fails, is cancelled, or throws mid-execution, its reserved budget slot is released (idempotent by task_id) so no project can be permanently locked out by crashed jobs
  3. A daily reconciliation job runs and logs any drift between `autonomy_daily_counters.reserved_count` and the authoritative count from `autonomy_events` for that project+date
  4. The duplicate budget check in `chat.ts` inactivity trigger is removed — the pipeline helper is the only budget authority in the codebase
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 23: Budget UX Surfaces
**Goal**: Users see their autonomy budget in real time, receive a soft warning before exhaustion, and get an in-character hard-stop (not a silent failure) when the cap hits — with the Free-tier upgrade path surfaced at the moment of friction
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Requirements**: BUDG-04, BUDG-05, BUDG-06, BUDG-07, BUDG-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees autonomy budget consumption displayed alongside message budget in the existing UsageBar, updating in real time as autonomous tasks complete
  2. User receives a visible soft warning (toast or inline notice) at 80% autonomy budget consumption, distinct from the hard-stop at 100%
  3. When a user's autonomy budget is exhausted, Maya delivers an in-character message explaining the stop (no raw "quota exceeded" error) and the next unblock condition
  4. Every `budget_blocked` event appears in the Activity feed with timestamp, the task that was blocked, and the triggering agent
  5. A Free-tier user hitting the autonomy cap sees the existing UpgradeModal with autonomy-specific upgrade framing
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 24: Scheduler Foundation
**Goal**: The system can reliably fire recurring autonomous tasks on a cron schedule across restarts and multi-node deploys — reusing the existing execution pipeline (budget, safety, peer review, handoffs, events) with zero duplicate code paths
**Depends on**: Phase 22 (budget must be atomic before scheduling multiplies concurrency)
**Requirements**: SCHED-01, SCHED-02, SCHED-03, SCHED-04, SCHED-05, SCHED-06, SCHED-07, SCHED-08, SCHED-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A developer/API consumer can create a scheduled routine via `POST /api/routines` with agent, cron expression, IANA timezone, and instruction — and see it fire at the next cron tick
  2. When a scheduled fire occurs, the routine enqueues a row into `tasks` and hands off to the existing `autonomous_task_execution` pg-boss queue — there is no parallel execution pipeline
  3. After each run, `last_run_status` and `last_run_task_id` on the routine are updated; after 3 consecutive failures the routine auto-pauses with `paused_reason` populated
  4. Deleting an agent or project cascades to remove the associated scheduled routines (no dangling pg-boss schedules)
  5. Only Pro-tier users can create routines (enforced by existing `tierGate` middleware); each project is capped at 10 active routines; on server boot all active routines re-register with pg-boss
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 25: Chat-Native Routine Creation
**Goal**: Users create routines by talking to a Hatch in plain English ("Kai, draft the growth update every Monday at 9am") — no cron UI, no settings panel, just a conversation that returns an in-character confirmation card and resists prompt-injection attacks through the scheduled phrase
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: CHAT-01, CHAT-02, CHAT-03, CHAT-04, CHAT-05, CHAT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a user messages an agent with a natural-language schedule phrase, the agent responds with an in-character confirmation card showing the parsed cron, timezone, and task template — no routine is created until the user confirms
  2. The `intentClassifier` emits `SCHEDULE_REQUEST` before `EXPLICIT_TASK_REQUEST` on ambiguous phrases like "create a task to send the update every Monday" (schedule intent wins)
  3. `schedulePhraseParser` converts supported NL phrases ("every Monday", "daily at 9am", "every weekday morning") into valid cron expressions plus an IANA timezone string
  4. User can dismiss the confirmation card inline and no routine is persisted, no pg-boss schedule is registered
  5. NL instructions passed into downstream LLM prompts are capped at 500 characters and wrapped in delimited untrusted-data framing so adversarial schedule text cannot escape the data boundary
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 26: Routines Management Panel
**Goal**: Users can see, manage, and trust their scheduled routines from a dedicated sidebar surface — visibility on next run, recent history, cost, and clear controls (pause/resume/run-now/delete) without digging through chat
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: MGMT-01, MGMT-02, MGMT-03, MGMT-04, MGMT-05, MGMT-06, MGMT-07, MGMT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User opens the right sidebar and finds a Routines tab listing every active routine for the project, each card showing agent avatar, human-readable schedule, next run time, and last run status
  2. User can pause, resume, manually trigger ("Run now"), or delete any routine directly from its card — state changes reflect immediately in the UI and in pg-boss
  3. User can expand a routine card to see the last 30 runs with per-run status and cost
  4. Failed routine runs appear in Maya's return briefing when the user re-opens the app after being away; unread completions surface as a badge on the Routines tab
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 27: Polish + Integration Hardening
**Goal**: The correctness guarantees v3.0 promises are backed by mechanical tests — concurrency under load, DST transitions, multi-replica single-fire, and a red-team prompt-injection suite — so we ship with proof, not hope
**Depends on**: Phases 22-26
**Requirements**: VER-01, VER-02, VER-03, VER-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A concurrent-execution test spins up 10 parallel jobs against a budget limit of 5 and the test asserts exactly 5 pass and 5 are blocked — test is part of CI
  2. A fixed-date DST transition test (spring-forward and fall-back) proves routines fire at the correct wall-clock time in the configured IANA timezone
  3. A multi-replica test proves pg-boss fires each scheduled routine exactly once across N replicas — no double execution
  4. A red-team prompt-injection suite of ≥15 adversarial NL schedule phrases runs in CI and none escape the delimited framing introduced in Phase 25
**Plans**: TBD
